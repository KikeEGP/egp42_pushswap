**Project of 42's Common Core. Create a program and implement a sorting algorithm.**

**My purpouse**: create my own algorithm, using quartiles of n size of given arguments to divide integers in four defined blocks or chunks.
**Actual result**: divide in four was not so efficent. I finally divide in eight parts, and with my movement's design, my algorithm has become in a kind of handmade k-sort

**My principle**: to avoid iteration in stacks as far as I can
