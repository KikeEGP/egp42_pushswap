/*Function that checks if every node is in expected position*/
/*It could iterate and compare iteration index with t_stack->position*/
/*And storage number of times a number is not in expected place*/
/*Maybe, in case of few unexpected positions, 
 * could work with different instructions. But pdel-olm suggest to focus
 * in algorithm. In case of being well programmed, it should do this too*/
