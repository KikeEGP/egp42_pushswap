/*FUNCTION TO CHECK IF ARE NUMBERS*/
	/*If there can only be numbers, just check arg by arg*/
	/*If there can be a string with numbers, take care of it too*/
	/*Jump spaces. If find a + or -, check if it is correct*/
	/*Then, just isdigit*/

/*FUNCTION TO CREATE INT*/
	/*ft_atoi_protected(), which uses ft_atol() and check if it's integer*/
	/*If it's integer, return or put in stack_a*/

/*FUNCTION TO COMPARE INTEGERS*/
	/*Maybe shall do it with str. But i believe is better now*/

		 * This will take so much time...*/
